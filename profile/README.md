  # Where design systems become generative systems

  We believe AI should generate UIs that are correct by construction—not through endless prompt engineering, but through behavioral constraints that encode your design decisions.

  ### Our Stack

  **[plaited](https://github.com/plaited/plaited)** is a neuro-symbolic framework for AI-assisted design. Our agents, skills, and tooling train a world model that generates interfaces
  grounded in your design system.

  **[development-skills](https://github.com/plaited/development-skills)** equips AI coding agents with TypeScript LSP integration (type info, symbol search, reference finding), TSDoc
  documentation standards, cross-agent rule scaffolding, and validation tooling to verify project skills against the AgentSkills specification.

  **[acp-harness](https://github.com/plaited/acp-harness)** combines CLI tooling with agent skills for evaluation workflows. Capture trajectories, run trials, and use agentic assistance to
  calibrate failures, summarize results, and build scoring pipelines.

  **[skills-installer](https://github.com/plaited/skills-installer)** distributes Plaited skills to projects using agents that support the AgentSkills specification.
